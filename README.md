# Emulating Speech Patterns through Machine Learning

Project Webpage: https://gilarellano.github.io/LSTM_SpeechEmulation_Chelsea/

## Project Description
This project explores the possibilities of using artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic human speech patterns. We utilized machine learning models to generate text that emulates the speech patterns of a specific individual, and then converted that text to speech using an AI voice imitation software. The primary data source for this project was the video transcripts from Chelsea, a YouTuber who creates educational content about statistics and machine learning.

## How We Divided the Labor
Gilberto:
Was responsible for scraping the initial text files from Chelsea's YouTube videos. He created and trained the LSTM model, which served as our baseline for text generation. Also worked on polishing the final project report in Quarto.

Dyland:
Took on the task of modifying the transcript.txt file to fit his model. He meticulously worked on creating the fine-tuned GPT model, which was expected to perform better in generating text that matches Chelsea's speech style.

Both:
Collaborated on the presentation slides and data cleaning. Each member worked on the analysis and findings of their respective models, contributing their insights and interpretations to the final report.
